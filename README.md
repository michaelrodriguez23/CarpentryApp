<!-- PROJECT LOGO -->
<br />
<p align="left">
 Implemented a terminal application that can read, write, update, and delete flooring orders for a carpentry company. 
  Used MVC architecture that structured the code to handle products, taxes, and orders appropriately as POS System. 
  Files are saved both locally, and can be persisted to local path, as well as read and unmarshall delimitters. 
  The program can be toggled from production mode to training mode for new trainees on the job. It can be toggled by accessing the 
 application.context file, and switching the dependency.
